## Note to readers

The print version of the book (see below) was published in 2019, but we are
continually updating the online version. So if you spot any inaccuracies,
mistakes, typos, please let us know and we will do our best to improve the
book accordingly.

A particular issue is the code examples. R and its many packages on CRAN and
Bioconductor are a highly dynamic environment. We finalized the print version
in 2018 on R 3.5 and Bioconductor 3.7. We have been constantly updating the
code to changes in R or the packages. What you see here has been built using R
version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13) using the most recent release versions of all
packages on 2025-09-01. It is possible that we have overlooked unintended
changes whose detection is not easy to automate, e.g., in plot outputs or in
results from certain computations. We think that this risk is a prize worth
paying to enable readers to work in an up-to-date compute environment, but
apologize to our readers for possible confusions.

If you spot anything, please alert us via email to wolfgang.huber [at]
embl.org.
