For Alexander and Daniel.

This work would not be imaginable without the R language and environment for
statistical computing, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and the
Bioconductor project. We thank everyone who has contributed to these projects.
Today virtually every statistical algorithm, every imaginable interface for
data handling and visualization, and many methods from all over computer
science and mathematics are readily accessible through these projects.

We thank JJ Allaire and the RStudio (since 2022: Posit) team for making
available such a powerful development environment and many useful R packages,
which we have greatly enjoyed when writing this book. This includes the quarto
publishing system, which builds upon knitr and pandoc.

We particularly thank the Bioconductor project, powered by its amazing
community of developers, for fostering interoperability, scalability and
usability of R-based methods for genome-scale data, for making a vast range of
biological data and annotation resources easy to work with in R, and for
orchestrating collaborative, distributed development – all these aspects are
essential for the complex biological data analysis workflows that you will see
in this book.

We are grateful to the package developers we have worked with and whose
packages play at center stage in the different chapters of this book,
including [Simon Anders](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4868-1805), [Ben
Callahan](https://callahanlab.cvm.ncsu.edu/), [Michael
Love](https://mikelove.github.io/), [Joey
McMurdie](https://github.com/joey711), [Andrzej Oleś](https://www.geog.uni-
heidelberg.de/gis/oles.html). [Trevor Martin](http://trevormmartin.com/) was a
student in Stats 366 at Stanford in 2012 and co-taught the class with Susan in
2013, 2014 and 2015. As a graduate student in genetics, he brought many of the
examples to life and participated in earlier versions of the material we
present here. We are thankful for his help and perspective. Teaching
assistants for Stats 366 who have helped develop exercises and questions
include Austen Head, Haben Michael, [Julia
Fukuyama](https://jfukuyama.github.io/), [Lan Huong
Nguyen](https://nlhuong.github.io/), [Christof
Seiler](https://christofseiler.github.io/) and [Nikolaos
Ignatiadis](https://nignatiadis.github.io/). Their enthusiasm for making
interesting quizzes and lab material helped nurture students from a wide range
of backgrounds on the arduous journey of approaching challenging new concepts
within a computational environment that has tremendous power, yet can also be
overwhelming.

Many students have provided valuable feedback over the years, and we are
grateful for their many questions and quizzical looks that fed our motivation
to keep evolving this course. In particular, we have received extensive
feedback from Jessica Grembi, Kris Sankaran, Varun Gupta and Chao Jiang.

[Mike Smith](https://msmith.de/) has created the infrastructure for the online
HTML version that you are currently perusing, including a continuous
integration framework that enables us to continually update the book and see
the changes online within minutes, and the R package msmbstyle that was used
for rendering the print version of the book and the first years of the HTML
version. We thank [Helena Lucia Crowell](https://helenalc.github.io/) for her
excellent work porting the book’s sources from Sweave to quarto. [Sviatoslav
Kharuk](https://sviatkh.github.io/) made further improvements. We are very
grateful for their help and responsiveness.

We thank [Lorraine Garchery](https://histoires-de-lorraine.fr/) for design of
the cover art both for the printed and online version.

We thank David Tranah and Diana Gillooly from Cambridge University press for
their constant effort helping us to make the book grammatically correct,
aesthetically attractive and pedagogically coherent. Much potential for
improvement remains, the responsibility for which stays with us.

We thank our family and supporters who have encouraged us and provided
feedback on preliminary chapters: David Relman, Alfred Spormann, Catherine
Blish, Don Knuth, Persi Diaconis, Gretchen and Barry Mazur, …..
