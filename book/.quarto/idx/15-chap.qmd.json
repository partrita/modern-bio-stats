{"markdown":{"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"For Sonia, Sara, Agnès, Johnny, Camille  \n\\\\(...\\\\) and the “girls” who make me love the life sciences.\n\nFor Alexander and Daniel.\n\nThis work would not be imaginable without the R language and environment for\nstatistical computing, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and the\nBioconductor project. We thank everyone who has contributed to these projects.\nToday virtually every statistical algorithm, every imaginable interface for\ndata handling and visualization, and many methods from all over computer\nscience and mathematics are readily accessible through these projects.\n\nWe thank JJ Allaire and the RStudio (since 2022: Posit) team for making\navailable such a powerful development environment and many useful R packages,\nwhich we have greatly enjoyed when writing this book. This includes the quarto\npublishing system, which builds upon knitr and pandoc.\n\nWe particularly thank the Bioconductor project, powered by its amazing\ncommunity of developers, for fostering interoperability, scalability and\nusability of R-based methods for genome-scale data, for making a vast range of\nbiological data and annotation resources easy to work with in R, and for\norchestrating collaborative, distributed development – all these aspects are\nessential for the complex biological data analysis workflows that you will see\nin this book.\n\nWe are grateful to the package developers we have worked with and whose\npackages play at center stage in the different chapters of this book,\nincluding [Simon Anders](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4868-1805), [Ben\nCallahan](https://callahanlab.cvm.ncsu.edu/), [Michael\nLove](https://mikelove.github.io/), [Joey\nMcMurdie](https://github.com/joey711), [Andrzej Oleś](https://www.geog.uni-\nheidelberg.de/gis/oles.html). [Trevor Martin](http://trevormmartin.com/) was a\nstudent in Stats 366 at Stanford in 2012 and co-taught the class with Susan in\n2013, 2014 and 2015. As a graduate student in genetics, he brought many of the\nexamples to life and participated in earlier versions of the material we\npresent here. We are thankful for his help and perspective. Teaching\nassistants for Stats 366 who have helped develop exercises and questions\ninclude Austen Head, Haben Michael, [Julia\nFukuyama](https://jfukuyama.github.io/), [Lan Huong\nNguyen](https://nlhuong.github.io/), [Christof\nSeiler](https://christofseiler.github.io/) and [Nikolaos\nIgnatiadis](https://nignatiadis.github.io/). Their enthusiasm for making\ninteresting quizzes and lab material helped nurture students from a wide range\nof backgrounds on the arduous journey of approaching challenging new concepts\nwithin a computational environment that has tremendous power, yet can also be\noverwhelming.\n\nMany students have provided valuable feedback over the years, and we are\ngrateful for their many questions and quizzical looks that fed our motivation\nto keep evolving this course. In particular, we have received extensive\nfeedback from Jessica Grembi, Kris Sankaran, Varun Gupta and Chao Jiang.\n\n[Mike Smith](https://msmith.de/) has created the infrastructure for the online\nHTML version that you are currently perusing, including a continuous\nintegration framework that enables us to continually update the book and see\nthe changes online within minutes, and the R package msmbstyle that was used\nfor rendering the print version of the book and the first years of the HTML\nversion. We thank [Helena Lucia Crowell](https://helenalc.github.io/) for her\nexcellent work porting the book’s sources from Sweave to quarto. [Sviatoslav\nKharuk](https://sviatkh.github.io/) made further improvements. We are very\ngrateful for their help and responsiveness.\n\nWe thank [Lorraine Garchery](https://histoires-de-lorraine.fr/) for design of\nthe cover art both for the printed and online version.\n\nWe thank David Tranah and Diana Gillooly from Cambridge University press for\ntheir constant effort helping us to make the book grammatically correct,\naesthetically attractive and pedagogically coherent. Much potential for\nimprovement remains, the responsibility for which stays with us.\n\nWe thank our family and supporters who have encouraged us and provided\nfeedback on preliminary chapters: David Relman, Alfred Spormann, Catherine\nBlish, Don Knuth, Persi Diaconis, Gretchen and Barry Mazur, …..\n\nSusan Holmes, Stanford  \nWolfgang Huber, Heidelberg  \n  \n  \n  \nThe following readers contributed to improvements of the online version by\npointing out typos and opportunities for clarification: Eva-Maria Geissen,\nNick Cox, Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze, Tümay Capraz, Irilenia Nobeli, Asger\nHobolth, Iulian Ichim, …\n\nPage built at 01:33 on 2025-09-01 using R version 4.5.1
